    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS==  Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. \n",
    "For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. \n",
    "\n",
    " The main types of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single inheritance: \n",
    "    In single inheritance, a class inherits from a single base class. \n",
    "    This is the simplest form of inheritance. \n",
    "    The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class.\n",
    "CODE==\n",
    "class BaseClass:\n",
    "    # Base class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    # Derived class inherits from BaseClass\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Multiple inheritance: \n",
    "    In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple base classes. \n",
    "    This allows the derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "CODE==\n",
    "class BaseClass1:\n",
    "    # Base class 1 definition\n",
    "\n",
    "class BaseClass2:\n",
    "    # Base class 2 definition\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):\n",
    "    # Derived class inherits from BaseClass1 and BaseClass2\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multilevel inheritance: \n",
    "    In multilevel inheritance, a derived class can act as the base class for another class. \n",
    "    It forms a parent-child relationship between classes, creating a hierarchy.\n",
    "CODE==\n",
    "class BaseClass:\n",
    "    # Base class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "class IntermediateClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    # Intermediate class inherits from BaseClass\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass(IntermediateClass):\n",
    "    # Derived class inherits from IntermediateClass\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.Hierarchical inheritance: \n",
    "    In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. \n",
    "    This creates a hierarchy where multiple classes share the same base class.\n",
    "CODE==\n",
    "class BaseClass:\n",
    "    # Base class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass1(BaseClass):\n",
    "    # Derived class 1 inherits from BaseClass\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass2(BaseClass):\n",
    "    # Derived class 2 inherits from BaseClass\n",
    "Hybrid inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple types of inheritance. It involves using multiple inheritance along with other types of inheritance, such as multilevel or hierarchical inheritance.\n",
    "It's important to use inheritance carefully and consider the design and relationships between classes to ensure proper code organization and maintainability.\n",
